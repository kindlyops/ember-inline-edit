# ember-inline-edit

ember-inline-edit provides inline editing for your ember apps. Has basic keyboard support, too.

## Installation

`ember install ember-inline-edit`

## Usage

Use the `ember-inline-edit` component and provide it a default value.

```handlebars
  <EmberInlineEdit
    @value={{readonly this.value}}
    @onSave={{fn (mut this.value)}}
  />
```

This will give you a component that can be edited inline. To learn more, [please check out our documentation](https://kindlyops.github.io/ember-inline-edit/).

#### Keyboard Support

Inside the inputs (the textarea, input fields, etc.), if the user hits `enter`, it does exactly what a click on the save button would do (i.e. sends an `onSave` action and closes the editor).

If the user hits `esc`, the editor closes and sends the `onCancel` action.
